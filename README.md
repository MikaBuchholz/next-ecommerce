# Project-Recap on my first Next.js app

What this document will _contain_:

A short summary of what I planned and how it turned out. What I **learned**, what I am **satisfied** with and what _needs_ **improvement**. At last how my **workflow changed**.

---

## The summary

Primarly this was supposed to be an exercise to learn _next.js_. I also wanted to build a simple website focused on visuals - _animations_, good fitting _color palets_, sensiable _design_ and **good** mobile support.

My last projects where, for the main part, _TypeScript_ and _React_ heavy. The _TypeScript_ and **acutal useable** features would be what I spent most my time on. The design **was there**, but where **not** my primary worry.

That _was_ the plan.

I **did not** learn next the way I _wanted_ to.

## What I learned || _Next.js_

1. **Modular** _CSS_ in _Next.js_
2. Using _CSS_ in _Jsx_ / _Tsx_ with _Next.js_
3. _Pages_ and _routing_
4. _General_ **folder structuring**
5. _How_ the _Next.js_ **caching** works

---

## What I **not** learned but _wanted_ to || _Next.js_

**Quick note:**
When I started this project in knew little to nothing about Next.js. And did not intent for it to fall this short.

1. **SSR**
2. (More about) **Static Generation**
3. **Data-Fetching**
4. **ISR**

---

## What I learned || _CSS_

1. (More about) **Animations**
2. (More about) **Transitions** / **Transforms**
3. **Child combinators**
4. (Introduction to) **nth-child()**
5. Using _CSS_ in _combination_ with **conditional** _CSS_ (in the _JSX_ / _TSX_)

---

## What I am satisfied with

1. How the site **looks**
2. How **using** the site feels
3. The **animations / transitions**
4. The code splitting into **components**
5. **_THE MOBILE SUPPORT_** is ok (his time)

---

## What **NEEDS** improvement

Keeping the **DRY** principle in mind, the _CSS_ is **horrendous**. I just wanted to get the _animations to work_ and they did. I **repeated** myself dozens of times where I could have **avoided** it.

The **mobile support** is _ok_, I think. But I still have the **feeling / know** it has to be improved. Again **DRY**.

The _TSX_ / _JSX_ is **generally** fine.

---

## My workflow (_Old_ / _New_)

### **Old**:

When designing a website I **used** to just start. Start coding, _JSX_, _TSX_ and _CSS_ and see how the design turned out.

That is **not effecient in any way**. It worked, _ok_.

### **New**:

Now I open _Figma_, **sketch** out a design and try to implement it as code. This **works so much better** and results in **better code and websites**.
